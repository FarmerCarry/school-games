// The admin API's research reads and the owner's actions (docs/RESEARCH_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md,
// §F.4): the students, one student's page, one game's page, the r_stat metrics, retention
// cohorts and the PCs; and forgetting a student, linking and unlinking codes, and
// recounting every day. Each read takes the rolled days from the rollups and the
// days not rolled yet from the facts, through the rollups' own SELECT, as the KPIs do; the
// part of the rolled days is kept per rollup version (rv), the open part per 10-minute slot
// on Workers (store.mjs keeps them). Lists that only the facts hold (a student's recent
// rounds and sessions, tries before a first win, students per PC) are read by index from
// the facts and kept with the open part, or with the closed part when the period has no
// open day. A code counts as its canonical code (an older code linked to a newer one
// counts as the newer one), in SQL through the aliases table. Every answer takes at most 20
// statements, and JavaScript only merges small rows per student, day or game. Pure apart
// from the store context it is given (adminViews(ctx)).
