# Play statistics server and insights dashboard

This folder is a small service that receives play statistics **without names** from the
games portal (the portal's telemetry sink, `js/telemetry.js`; see
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), "Telemetry sink", "Milestone 2" and
"Milestone 2.5"), keeps them row by row under random codes (one per child's profile,
one per PC), and shows them on the insights dashboard at its own address.

It runs in one of two places, with the same code:

* **Cloudflare (recommended):** a free Cloudflare Worker with a free D1 database. One
  button sets it up; nothing to install, nothing to keep running.
* **Your own computer or server (Node):** `node main.mjs` with one SQLite file. See
  [Self-hosting on Node](#self-hosting-on-node).

The portal sends nothing until its fast build is given this server's address, so the
site works exactly as before without it.

## Turn on data collection (about 5 minutes, no code)

You need: an email address, your GitHub account (the one that holds the games site), and
a web browser. Everything below is free.

1. **Click this button:**

   [![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/FarmerCarry/school-games/tree/main/server)

2. **Sign up or sign in to Cloudflare.** If you have no Cloudflare account, choose
   *Sign up*, type your email address and a password of your choice, and open the
   confirmation email Cloudflare sends you. The free plan is all you need: if Cloudflare
   offers a paid plan, skip it.
3. **Connect GitHub when Cloudflare asks.** Click *Connect GitHub* (or *GitHub*), sign in
   to GitHub if asked, and allow Cloudflare. The button makes a **copy of this server in
   your own GitHub account** (a new repository, usually named `school-games-telemetry`),
   and Cloudflare runs that copy. This is normal and expected.
4. **Keep the suggested names.** Leave the project name `school-games-telemetry` and the
   database name `school-games-telemetry` as they are.
5. **Type a dashboard password** in the box named **`ADMIN_TOKEN`**. Make one up: **at
   least 16 English letters or digits, with no spaces** (for example
   `GreenTiger42Window7Lamp`, but make up your own). **Write it down on paper now.**
   You type it to open the dashboard, and Cloudflare keeps it secret: it cannot show it
   to you again later (you can only replace it, see below). If you see no box with that
   name, go on without it and add the password afterwards (see *Changing or setting the
   password later* below).
6. **Press *Create and deploy*** (it may just say *Deploy*).
7. **Wait** one to three minutes, until Cloudflare says the deployment succeeded. If
   Cloudflare first asks you to choose a *workers.dev* name (a subdomain), type a short
   name in English letters, for example your school's name: it becomes part of the address.
8. **Copy the address** it shows. It looks like
   `https://school-games-telemetry.<your-name>.workers.dev`. Send that address to the
   developer (an email or a chat message is fine). The developer then switches the games
   site on, and children's PCs start sending statistics (without names).
   A PC's play reaches the server only when the PC opens the games **website** and the
   school's internet lets the PC reach this address. A web filter that blocks
   `*.workers.dev` or new sites stops it silently: ask the school's IT to allow the
   address. A copy opened from a downloaded folder never sends. On each PC, the teacher
   page (🏫 then 📊) has a box «الإرسال إلى لوحة المؤشرات في المدرسة» that shows whether
   its play gets through, and a button «اختبر الاتصال الآن» that tests the connection.
   Play that cannot be sent waits on the PC and goes by itself once the address is
   allowed (space is limited: after a few hours of play, or after 7 days, the oldest
   goes first).
9. **Open that address** in your browser to see the dashboard, and sign in with the
   password from step 5. Until children play, there is nothing to show; add `/?demo` to
   the address to see the dashboard with made-up sample data.

**It is free for a school.** Cloudflare's free plan allows 100,000 requests to the
server per day (a PC sends one about every minute of play and one when a game closes;
500 play sessions send about 4,600 to 5,700; the server's own work every 5 minutes adds
about 300), and its free D1 database allows 500 MB per database, 5 million rows read and
100,000 rows written per day. A busy school (500 play sessions a day) writes a little
under half of the daily allowance in the first year and keeps about 350 MB after it
(see [Free-plan arithmetic](#free-plan-arithmetic)). The server counts its own use, and
when a day's writes run high it asks the PCs to send less often (the `X-Batch-Every`
answer header), and when a day's reads run high the dashboard waits until the next day.
If a limit were ever reached, the server stops answering until midnight UTC: nothing is
charged (the free plan has no bill), and the PCs keep their statistics for up to 7 days
and send them later.

**Changing or setting the password later:** on [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com),
open *Workers & Pages*, then `school-games-telemetry`, then *Settings*, then *Variables and
Secrets*. Edit `ADMIN_TOKEN` (or add it, type *Secret*), type the new password and press
*Deploy*. A password shorter than 16 characters, or one with a space, does not count:
the dashboard then says that the password was not set (the statistics are still
collected), and you set a longer one here.

## Before you turn it on

The players are **children aged 6 to 11**. No names are collected, but each child's play
is kept under a random code, so these records are **pseudonymous personal data** under
GDPR-style rules (the GDPR, the UK GDPR and its Children's Code; COPPA and FERPA notions
in the United States): tell parents before collection starts, give your privacy
reviewers the section "What is collected and kept" below, and check whether publishing
research from it needs consent or an ethics review. A PC sends nothing while a teacher
has stopped statistics on it (the teacher page), and browsers that send Global Privacy
Control never send anything.

## Files

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `worker.mjs` | Cloudflare entry: `fetch` (the handler on the D1 database `env.DB`, the dashboard from `env.ASSETS`) and `scheduled` (the daily purge, and every 5 minutes the rollups and the sweep of the live rows). |
| `wrangler.json` | The Worker's settings: D1 binding `DB`, static assets `./dashboard`, two crons (the daily purge, and every 5 minutes the rollups and the sweep of the live rows), `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `RETENTION_DAYS`, request logs (observability) off. |
| `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | Wrangler 4.149.0 for deploying (a development tool only), the plain-English descriptions the Deploy button shows, `npm start` for Node. |
| `.dev.vars.example` | Tells the Deploy button to ask for the `ADMIN_TOKEN` secret (empty on purpose). |
| `handler.mjs` | The HTTP rules as a Fetch-API handler, shared by both hosts: routes, CORS, the soft rate limit, body limits, admin password, the admin router (methods, parameters, guards), status codes. |
| `store.mjs` | The facts (sessions, game visits, rounds, marks, students, PCs) over a D1-style SQL driver; creates and upgrades its tables itself, one version step at a time; the 5-minute rollups, KPIs, live sessions, settings, retention, the usage meter and its guards, and the kept parts of answers. |
| `admin.mjs` | The research reads (the students, one student, one game, the `r_stat` metrics, retention cohorts, the PCs) and the owner's actions (forget a student, link and unlink codes, recount), in SQL over the rollups and the facts not rolled yet. |
| `export.mjs` | The research export: each file's pinned columns (`COLUMNS`) and its pages of CSV lines, built in SQL. |
| `rollups.mjs` | The daily rollups of the facts by the school's local day, and milestone 2's frozen daily totals: their tables, and for each rollup the one SQL `SELECT` that defines it. |
| `schema.mjs` | Validation of the envelope (wire versions 2 and 3) and every event kind; cleans and clamps. |
| `clock.mjs` | The school's clock: UTC offsets, local days and the exact bounds of a local day in an IANA zone, from `Intl` alone. |
| `sqlite-d1.mjs` | A D1-style driver over Node's built-in `node:sqlite`, for the Node host and the tests. |
| `app.mjs`, `main.mjs` | The Node host: `node:http` in front of the handler, settings from the environment, a purge every 24 hours, the rollups every 5 minutes. |
| `static.mjs` | The Node host's static file server for `dashboard/`, with the headers of `dashboard/_headers`. |
| `dashboard/` | The insights dashboard (static files), served at `/` by both hosts. `_headers` gives every page a strict Content-Security-Policy. |
| `warnings.mjs` | Hides Node 22's one `node:sqlite` ExperimentalWarning (and nothing else). |
| `simulate.mjs` | A deterministic simulated school (600 children in 24 classes on 30 PCs, mostly wire version 3, at the portal sink's real batch cadence) for dashboard development, tests and measurements; `--db` writes weeks of history and rolls each day up as the cron would. |
| `fixtures/sample-batch.json`, `fixtures/sample-batch-v3.json` | A valid v2 and a valid v3 envelope, each with every event kind of its version (shared with the portal's tests). |
| `Dockerfile` | A minimal `node:22-alpine` image of the Node host. |

The folder is self-contained (it imports nothing from outside it), because the Deploy
button copies only this folder into a new repository.

## What is collected and kept

What can be stored is decided here, not only by what the portal chooses to send.

* **No names, nothing a child types.** The contract has no field for a name, typed
  text, error text, a PC label, a profile key, an avatar or colour, a user-agent or a
  GPU string. The server validates every field against closed lists and patterns
  (`schema.mjs`) and drops anything else: unknown envelope fields are ignored, an event
  with an extra or a malformed field is dropped whole, and round ids that could be typed
  text (three digits in a row, spaces, more than 24 characters) are refused.
* **Random codes, so pseudonymous.** A batch of wire version 3 carries a random code for
  the child's profile (`u`: 12 lowercase hex) and one for the PC (`p`: 12 hex), made on
  the PC and never derived from anything about the child, and the PC's zone name (such
  as `Asia/Riyadh`). A value of any other form is stored as unknown (`''`), never as
  sent. Guests send no code. Because the codes keep one child's play together over time,
  these records are pseudonymous personal data.
* **Play is kept row by row.** Each play session, game visit, round and mark (a level-up,
  a heart, a tutorial step, the classroom timer, a removed profile, an older code of the
  same child) is a row of the facts, with the session's code and PC code. A student row
  holds the code, a label (its first 4 to 12 characters, as the dashboard shows it), the
  age band, the first and last play and the profile's age in days. Older v2 batches are
  stored the same way, with no codes.
* **No IP addresses and no headers are stored or logged.** The client address
  (`CF-Connecting-IP` on Cloudflare, the socket address or a trusted `X-Forwarded-For`
  hop on Node) is only a key of the in-memory rate limiter and is forgotten once its
  bucket has refilled. Requests and request bodies are never logged. On Cloudflare,
  Workers observability (stored request logs, which would hold IP addresses) is
  **off** in `wrangler.json`; keep it off. The only log lines are start-up and purge
  counts (Node) and internal error messages.
* **No wall-clock times from the client.** Events carry seconds since the session
  started, and a v3 batch the seconds from the session's start to its sending (`w`).
  The server dates the session by its own clock at receipt minus `w` (for v2: minus the
  batch's last event time and 10 seconds), so a PC whose clock is wrong still dates its
  play correctly; days and hours follow the school's zone.
* **Coarse buckets.** Devices are reported as cores (1, 2, 4, 8, 16), memory in GB
  (0, 1, 2, 4, 8) and screen width (1366, 1600, 1920, 2560); age as a band (6-7, 8-9,
  10-11 or unknown); reaction times, input latency and frame times as fixed histograms.
* **Every number is shown.** The dashboard's answers show every group with its numbers,
  even one child's (nothing is hidden for small groups any more); only the dashboard
  password opens them.
* **Forgetting a student.** The owner can delete one student on the dashboard (`POST
  /v1/admin/forget`): every session, game visit, round and mark of the student's codes
  (a code and every code linked to it), their student and PC lists, their per-student
  rollups, live rows and links, and the marks in other sessions that name one of their
  codes (the removal of their profile, or an older code whose link was undone). A PC
  keeps each batch until it sees the server's answer, so the last batch of a page that
  closed goes again from the PC's next page, often the next day: for 8 days the server
  keeps the codes themselves with the time of the forget (the setting `forgotten`, which
  the dashboard never shows; the 5-minute cron then removes them), drops every batch of
  theirs from a session that started before it, and drops every mark that names one of
  them (the removal of a profile, or an older code, which a PC may tell again or late)
  from a session that started by the forget or before that code played again, so the
  student does not come back. A later session of the same code (its profile stays on the PC) is new play
  and is kept, and so is a mark naming the code from a session after it (a removal of
  that profile, or a link to that code). The 8 days cover a batch sent again (a PC keeps
  one at most 7 days), but not an older code that a PC tells as `cd` until a batch
  naming it is delivered: a `cd` that first gets through more than 8 days after the
  forget (after a long break, or on a blocked network) stores the link again. It names
  only the code, none of its play, and forgetting again removes it with the student it
  is linked to. On Cloudflare, another Worker instance learns of the forget when it next
  reads the settings, within 5 minutes; until then it may still store such a batch
  (forget again to remove it). The school-wide daily counts, in which no child can be
  found, keep the play already counted until a recount (`POST /v1/admin/rebuild`) makes
  them again from the facts left. D1 *Time Travel* can still restore the database to any
  minute of the last 7 days.
* **Downloads.** The research export (`GET /v1/admin/export`) gives the rows themselves,
  under the same codes. Once downloaded they are outside the server's retention: keep
  them like other school records.
* **Retention.** The daily purge (Cloudflare: a cron at 03:23 UTC; Node: at start and
  every 24 hours) deletes the facts of play sessions that started more than
  `RETENTION_DAYS` days ago (default 400: a school year and the summer; the owner can
  choose 760 on the dashboard), the frozen daily totals of milestone 2 older than that,
  batch ids after 30 days and the server's usage counts after 60 days. The daily rollups
  (counts per day, per game, per student code) are kept 800 days, or longer if the facts
  are, and the student and PC rows (with their links) as long as the rollups that name
  them: until their last day of play is past the rollups' retention. Live rows
  go by a sweep every 5 minutes (Node: every minute). If the database nears the free
  plan's 500 MB, the round-by-round rows of the oldest 30 days of facts are removed (the
  rollups stay). Deletions go a few hundred sessions at a time, so a shorter retention
  takes a few nights to reach the new cutoff. On Node, SQLite's `secure_delete`
  overwrites deleted rows and the write-ahead log is truncated after each purge.

## Self-hosting on Node

Node 22.13 or newer (where `node:sqlite` needs no flag); no `npm install` and no
runtime dependencies.

```sh
export ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
node server/main.mjs &
# telemetry: listening on port 8787; 0 allowed origin(s), admin on, ...
curl -s localhost:8787/v1/health                    # {"ok":true,"accepts":[2,3],"schema":4}
node server/simulate.mjs --sessions 200             # synthetic sessions (today)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" localhost:8787/v1/admin/kpis
# the dashboard: http://localhost:8787/
```

The default database is `server/data/telemetry.db` (ignored by Git).

### Configuration

All settings are environment variables.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8787` | TCP port. `0` picks a free one (printed at start). |
| `HOST` | all interfaces | Bind address. Use `127.0.0.1` behind a reverse proxy on the same machine. |
| `DB_PATH` | `server/data/telemetry.db` | SQLite file (created with its folder). Also writes `-wal` and `-shm` files next to it. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | none | Comma-separated origins of the portal, e.g. `https://name.github.io` (an origin has no path and no trailing slash, even when the site lives at `/school-games/`). Browser requests from any other origin get no CORS header and `POST /v1/batch` answers `403`. The literal `null` (pages from `file:` or sandboxed frames) is accepted only if listed; the portal never sends from `file:`. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | none | The dashboard password: the bearer token for `/v1/admin/*`, at least 16 printable ASCII characters without spaces (use `openssl rand -hex 24`). Unset: the admin endpoints answer `404`. |
| `RETENTION_DAYS` | `400` | Days of play facts to keep (1 to 36,500); the daily rollups are kept at least 800 days. The owner's choice on the dashboard (`keepDays`) wins. |
| `RATE_PER_MIN` | `1200` | Requests per minute per client address (token bucket, bursts up to the same number). Generous because a whole school lab shares one NAT address. `0` turns the limit off. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `0` | Number of reverse proxies in front of the server. With `1`, the client address for the rate limit is the last `X-Forwarded-For` entry (the one your proxy wrote); with `0` it is the socket address, so all traffic through a proxy shares one bucket. |

The server refuses to start on a malformed origin, a short admin token, a bad number,
or a database written by a newer version of the server.

On Cloudflare the same settings are `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `RETENTION_DAYS` (plain
variables in `wrangler.json`, default `https://farmercarry.github.io` and `400`),
`ADMIN_TOKEN` (a secret; an invalid one turns the admin endpoints off rather than
stopping the Worker) and the optional `RATE_PER_MIN` (the limit is per Worker
instance, so it is soft).

### Deploying

The Node host speaks plain HTTP. **Always run it behind a TLS reverse proxy**: the
portal only sends to `https://` URLs, and GitHub Pages is served over HTTPS. Configure
the proxy **not to log client IP addresses**, and keep request bodies out of its logs.

**Docker:**

```sh
docker build -t school-games-telemetry server/
docker run -d --name sg-telemetry --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 -v sg-telemetry:/data \
  -e ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://name.github.io -e TRUST_PROXY=1 \
  -e ADMIN_TOKEN="$(cat /etc/sg-telemetry/admin-token)" \
  school-games-telemetry
```

The image runs as the unprivileged `node` user, stores the database in the `/data`
volume, serves the dashboard and has a health check on `/v1/health`.

**A small VM with systemd:** copy the `server/` folder to `/opt/sg-telemetry` and
install Node 22.13 or newer (for example from nodejs.org or NodeSource). Then
`/etc/systemd/system/sg-telemetry.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=School games telemetry ingest
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /opt/sg-telemetry/main.mjs
Environment=HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8787 TRUST_PROXY=1 DB_PATH=/var/lib/sg-telemetry/telemetry.db
Environment=ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://name.github.io
# The admin token, as the line ADMIN_TOKEN=... in a file only root can read (chmod 600).
# The leading "-" lets the service start without the file (admin endpoints off).
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sg-telemetry.env
DynamicUser=yes
StateDirectory=sg-telemetry
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
NoNewPrivileges=yes
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`systemctl enable --now sg-telemetry`. The journal receives only the server's own
lines, which never contain addresses.

**Caddy** (automatic HTTPS; Caddy writes no access log unless you add a `log` directive):

```
telemetry.example.org {
	request_body {
		max_size 64KB
	}
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
}
```

**nginx:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name telemetry.example.org;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/telemetry.example.org/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/telemetry.example.org/privkey.pem;
    access_log off;                 # never log children's IP addresses
    error_log /var/log/nginx/telemetry.error.log crit;  # lower levels include the client address
    client_max_body_size 64k;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;  # replaces any client-supplied value
    }
}
```

**Any other Node host** that runs `node main.mjs` (or `npm start` in `server/`) with Node
22.13+, gives it a persistent disk for `DB_PATH` and terminates TLS works (one instance:
SQLite is a single file). Check that the platform's request logs can be configured
without client IPs, or turned off.

## Pointing the portal at the server

The source tree never contains a URL. The fast build (`tools/build.mjs`) reads the
**`SG_TELEMETRY_URL`** environment variable and injects it into the portal as
`window.SG_TELEMETRY.url`; the portal's sink (`js/telemetry.js`) is the only code that
uses it. It must start with `https://` and name the batch endpoint: the Worker's
address plus `/v1/batch`, for example
`https://school-games-telemetry.name.workers.dev/v1/batch`.

* **This project:** `.github/workflows/build.yml` names the school's Worker,
  `https://school-games-telemetry.services-agreement137.workers.dev/v1/batch`; a `SG_TELEMETRY_URL`
  repository variable overrides it, and removing the address from the workflow switches
  the portal off.
* **GitHub Pages in general:** in the repository, *Settings → Secrets and variables →
  Actions → Variables → New repository variable*, name `SG_TELEMETRY_URL`; delete it and
  rebuild to switch telemetry off.
* **A local build:** `SG_TELEMETRY_URL=https://telemetry.example.org/v1/batch node tools/build.mjs`.
* `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must list the site's origin (on Cloudflare it already lists
  `https://farmercarry.github.io`).

## Updating the server

**On Cloudflare** the Worker runs the copy of this folder in the owner's GitHub
repository (`FarmerCarry/school-games-telemetry`), and Cloudflare deploys every push to
it. To update it:

1. Before the first update to milestone 2.5, measure the batch rate (below) while the
   old server still runs.
2. Copy this `server/` folder **byte for byte** to the root of that repository: every
   file except that repository's own `wrangler.json`, which names its D1 database. In
   that `wrangler.json` change only `RETENTION_DAYS`, to `"400"` for milestone 2.5.
   Commit and push; Cloudflare deploys within a few minutes.
3. **Check:**
   * `https://<your worker>/v1/health` answers `{"ok": true, "accepts": [2, 3], "schema": 4}`;
   * a real batch from a PC on wire version 2 is answered `204` (the first request after
     the deploy may be answered `503` once, while the database is upgraded; the PC sends
     it again);
   * `/?demo` shows the dashboard with sample data;
   * after signing in, the days before the update and the new "student unknown"
     sessions show every number;
   * the next 5-minute cron runs without errors (*Workers & Pages* →
     `school-games-telemetry` → *Metrics*), and the meters on the Settings page move;
   * watch one school day.
4. Only then is the portal's wire version 3 published: a server older than milestone 2.5
   answers `400` to a version 3 batch, and the portal drops such a batch for good.

**Rolling back.** A server older than schema 4 refuses a database this one has
upgraded, so going back is one of:

* deploying this server again with a fix (the database stays as it is): once the
  portal's wire version 3 is published (step 4), this is the only safe way; or
* before step 4 only: restoring the database with D1 *Time Travel* (free; any minute of
  the last 7 days) to just before the deploy, then deploying milestone 2's server. The
  restore is in the Cloudflare dashboard (*Storage & databases* → *D1* →
  `school-games-telemetry` → *Time Travel*) or `npx wrangler d1 time-travel restore
  school-games-telemetry --timestamp=<the time, RFC 3339>`. Schema 4 keeps milestone 2's
  daily totals frozen as they were, so a restore to just before the deploy is a clean
  milestone 2 database; what arrived after that point is lost.

After step 4, milestone 2's server answers `400` to every version 3 batch, and a PC
drops a batch answered `400` for good: going back to milestone 2 would lose every PC's
data from then on. It would first need the portal from before step 4 published again
and loaded by every PC (an open tab keeps the newer portal until it is reloaded), and
the version 3 batches the PCs still hold would be lost even then.

While the server answers `5xx` or cannot be reached (during a deploy, or the `503` of
the upgrade), the PCs keep what they could not send for up to 7 days and send it later;
any other `4xx` answer than `429` is final.

**On Node,** stop the server, back up the database (see [Operations](#operations)),
replace the folder and start it again: the Node host upgrades the database at start.
Going back means that backup.

### Measuring the batch rate first (Step 0)

Before the first update to milestone 2.5, with milestone 2's server still running, open
the D1 console (Cloudflare → *Storage & databases* → *D1* → `school-games-telemetry` →
*Console*) and run, one at a time:

```sql
SELECT day, COUNT(*) FROM batches GROUP BY day ORDER BY day DESC LIMIT 14;
SELECT day, SUM(sessions) FROM agg_days GROUP BY day ORDER BY day DESC LIMIT 14;
```

Divide each school day's batches by its sessions and record the ratio below. If it is
above 16, the portal's default batch timer for wire version 3 goes from 60 to 90 seconds
(`docs/RESEARCH_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md`, §B.6), before that version is published.

| Measured on | School days | Batches per session (portal on wire version 2, 20 s timer) |
|---|---|---|
| not measured yet (needs the Cloudflare account) | | |

For comparison, the simulated school (`simulate.mjs`) sends 15.4 batches per version 2
session (20 s timer) and 11.3 per version 3 session (60 s timer, and one when a game
closes).

## API

Every API response (paths under `/v1/`) has `Vary: Origin`, `Cache-Control: no-store`,
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and, for an origin in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`,
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <that origin>` and `Access-Control-Expose-Headers:
Retry-After, X-Batch-Every`. Credentials are never allowed. Error bodies are `{"error": "<short
reason>"}` (a `429` from a guard adds `until`) and never echo the request. Every request that reaches the server (including
`OPTIONS`, health checks and, on Node, dashboard files) takes a token from the client's
rate-limit bucket; an empty bucket answers `429` with `Retry-After` in seconds.

### `GET /` and other paths outside `/v1/`

The dashboard's static files from `dashboard/` (`GET` and `HEAD` only; missing files are
`404`, and other methods `404` on Node and `405` on Cloudflare). On Cloudflare, Workers static assets serve them; on Node,
`static.mjs` serves only regular files inside the folder (no dot files, no `_headers`,
no path outside it). Both send the headers in `dashboard/_headers`: a
Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'` and `script-src 'self'`; the game names come
bundled in `names.js`), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and `Cache-Control: no-store` for the page.

### `POST /v1/batch`

The body is the telemetry envelope as JSON, sent as `text/plain` (a CORS "simple
request" without a preflight) or `application/json`. Wire version 2 (`"v": 2`, the
portal until milestone 2.5) and version 3 (`"v": 3`) are both accepted, version 2
indefinitely (queues of up to 7 days, cached portals). See
`fixtures/sample-batch.json`, `fixtures/sample-batch-v3.json`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
and `docs/RESEARCH_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md` ("Wire format v3").

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `204` | Stored, or already stored: a repeated v2 batch id is answered the same, and a v3 batch delivered again changes nothing, so the client drops it. Unknown event kinds and malformed events are dropped silently; the rest of the batch is kept. The header `X-Batch-Every` gives the seconds the PC should wait between batches: `60` while the day's rows written are at most 60,000, `180` up to 80,000, `300` above. |
| `400` | Not JSON, or an invalid envelope: `v` is not `2` or `3`; `b` is not 16 lowercase hex; `s` is not 12 lowercase hex; `k` is not `src` or exactly 16 lowercase hex; `m` is not `web`/`app`; `a` is not `6-7`/`8-9`/`10-11`/`''`; `d` is not `[cores, memoryGB, screenWidth]` from the bucket lists; `ev` is not an array of at most 200 entries. |
| `403` | The request has an `Origin` header that is not in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Requests without `Origin` (tools, `simulate.mjs`) are accepted. |
| `413` | The body is over 64 KB (65,536 bytes), declared or streamed. |
| `415` | Another content type. |
| `429` | Rate limited. |
| `503` | `{"error": "updating"}` with `Retry-After: 2`: this request created or upgraded the database (one version step) and did nothing else. The portal sends the batch again. Only on Cloudflare: the Node host upgrades at start. |

The fields version 3 adds to the envelope are lenient, because the portal drops a batch
for good on any `4xx`: a malformed value is stored as unknown and the batch is kept.

| Field | Accepted | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `u` | a student code: 12 lowercase hex; `''` for a guest | `''` |
| `p` | a PC code: 12 lowercase hex, or `''` | `''` |
| `z` | an IANA zone this server knows (or `UTC`), at most 40 characters | `''` |
| `w` | a whole number of seconds from 0 to 691,200 (8 days): the session's age when the batch was sent | `null` (the session is dated from the receipt time) |

Event validation (exact length; every field must pass):

| Event | v2 fields after the kind | v3 fields after the kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ss` | `t`, isNew `0`/`1`, profile age `0`–`3`, days since last `0`–`4`, level ≥ 0 | `t`, isNew, profile age in days and days since the last play (`-1`–`36500`), level, profiles on the PC (≤ 99), classroom mode `0`/`1` |
| `go` | `t`, slug, source (`featured catalog recent favorites category quick search related surprise reload history direct starter`), plays before `0`–`4` | `t`, visit `n` (`1`–`9999`), slug, source, plays before (≤ 10⁶), favourite `0`/`1` |
| `ld` | `t`, slug, load ms | `t`, `n`, slug, load ms |
| `er` | `t`, slug, kind `t`/`x`/`l` | `t`, `n`, slug, kind |
| `rs` | `t`, slug, round id, tier `0`–`9`, replay index | `t`, `n`, round `k` (`1`–`99999`), slug, round id, tier, replay index |
| `re` | `t`, slug, code `w`/`l`/`d`/`e`/`q`, round id, ms, score (`-1` or ≥ 0), tier `0`–`9`, hits, misses, `rt[6]` | `t`, `n`, `k`, slug, then as v2, then `x`: `null` or `[wallMs, inputs, idleLapses, pauses, rtSumMs, rtN, ddaPermille]` (lenient: anything else is `null` and the round is kept) |
| `gp` | | `t`, `n`, slug, engaged ms so far |
| `gx` | `t`, slug, engaged ms, `il[6]`, `f[4]` | `t`, `n`, slug, engaged ms, `il[6]`, `f[4]` |
| `tu` | | `t`, `n`, slug, tutorial step `s`/`d` |
| `fv` | | `t`, `n`, slug, heart on `1` or off `0` |
| `ct` | | `t`, classroom timer `s`/`c`/`e`, minutes (≤ 120) |
| `lv` | `t`, level ≥ 1 | the same |
| `pr` | | `t`, the code of a profile removed on this PC |
| `cd` | | `t`, an older code of this student (linked to `u`) |
| `se` | `t`, engaged ms | `t`, engaged ms, why the session ended `u`/`p`/`h`/`i` |

Slugs match `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$` (at most 40 characters); round ids match
`^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_:.-]{0,23}$` without three digits in a row. Neither may be a
built-in object key such as `constructor`. Enumerations, flags, buckets and tiers must
be exact integers. Measured numbers (`t`, ms, counts, scores, levels, histogram
entries) must be finite and not negative; they are rounded and clamped to: `t` 7 days
in seconds, level 999, load 120,000 ms, replay index 9,999, round 3 h, score 10⁹,
hits/misses/`rt`/`il` entries 100,000, each frame bucket 10⁷, game visit 6 h, session 24 h.

### `OPTIONS *`

`204`. For an allowed origin also `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST,
DELETE, OPTIONS`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization` and
`Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400`.

### `GET /v1/health`

`200 {"ok": true, "accepts": [2, 3], "schema": 4}`: the wire versions this server takes
and its database schema. It never touches the database, so it is the check to make
before a portal that sends version 3 is published.

### Admin endpoints

| Route under `/v1/admin/` | Methods | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `kpis`, `students`, `student`, `game`, `stats`, `cohorts`, `pcs` | `GET` | reads |
| `export` | `GET` | export reads |
| `live` | `GET` | none |
| `settings` | `GET`, `POST` | none |
| `forget`, `rebuild` | `POST` | writes |
| `link` | `POST`, `DELETE` | writes |

There are no player cards: the owner dropped them for good, so a student code is always
a profile's 12 hex digits and there is no `cards` route (`/v1/admin/cards` answers `404`
like any unknown path). A child who plays on two PCs is
joined by the teacher page's code transfer (the `cd` mark) or by the owner's link.

`HEAD` goes with every `GET`. Every admin route needs `Authorization: Bearer
<ADMIN_TOKEN>` (compared in constant time). Without a valid token: `401` with
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. With no valid `ADMIN_TOKEN` set: `404 {"error": "admin
password not set"}` (the dashboard shows this as "the password was not set"). A method a
route does not take: `405` with `Allow`, the route's methods (with `HEAD` for a `GET`
route) and `OPTIONS`. The request that upgrades the database answers `503` as for
batches. Every JSON answer has `"v": 1` and the school's clock, `"clock": {"tz",
"source", "offsetMin", "today"}` (`today` is the school's local day).

**Parameters.** `from`, `to` and `band` as for the KPIs below: days `from`..`to` of the
school's clock (inclusive, at most 366; default the 30 days ending today) and `band`
`all` (default), `6-7`, `8-9`, `10-11` or `unknown`. A student code `u` is 12 lowercase
hex; a game `slug` is as in batches. A malformed parameter, or a missing one that has no
default: `400 {"error": "<its name>"}`.

**Bodies.** `POST` takes a JSON body (`Content-Type: application/json`, at most 4 KB);
`DELETE /v1/admin/link` may take one. Over 4 KB: `413`; another media type: `415`; not
JSON: `400 {"error": "json"}`; not an object: `400 {"error": "body"}`; a field the route
does not take: `400 {"error": "field"}`. There is no cookie, so another site cannot make
a browser send these requests.

**Nothing is hidden:** every group is shown with its numbers, even a single session or
a single child (`minSessions` is `0`, and no group is ever `suppressed`). A dashboard
should mark small numbers as early signs instead.

**The free allowances.** D1's free plan stops every query for the rest of the UTC day
once 5 million rows have been read, and every write once 100,000 rows have been
written. As far as the server's own meter knows: once the day's reads pass 4.2 million,
the admin reads answer `429 {"error": "reads", "until": "03:00"}`, `until` being the next
00:00 UTC on the school's clock; export pages answer so from 3.5 million, so that an
export stops well before the dashboard does; once the day's writes pass 90,000, `forget`,
`link` and `rebuild` answer `429 {"error": "writes", "until": ...}`. `live` and
`settings` always answer, and batches are never refused.

Writes are metered per instance and flushed at the start of a batch at most once a
minute, before anything in that batch reads the day's usage; the crons end by writing
their own counts, so a cron run in a new Worker instance is counted too.

**Kept parts.** Each read takes the days already rolled up from the rollups and the
days after them (today, and yesterday until the night's roll) from the facts, through
the rollups' own SQL, so both count alike (`stats`, `cohorts` and a game's `stats` and
flows take the rolled days only). The part of the rolled days is kept in
`kpi_cache` under the route, its parameters and the rollup version `rv`, and in the
instance's memory for an hour; on Cloudflare the part of the other days is kept 10
minutes (on Node it is made on every request). A part over 1 MB is not kept. Each roll
(a recount's too), forget, link and unlink, and a PC's new link (a `cd` mark), raises `rv`, so later answers are made again
(a Worker instance that kept a part in memory sees the new `rv` within 5 minutes).
Every answer takes at most 20 statements.

#### `GET /v1/admin/kpis?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD&band=6-7`

Days `from`..`to` (inclusive, at most 366 days; default: the 30 days ending today on the
school's clock). Days up to the update to schema 4 (`range.legacyUntil`) are the frozen
UTC receipt days of milestone 2, which did not tell students apart; days from
`range.factsSince` on are the school's local days. On the one day both cover, both add
up. `band` is `all` (default), `6-7`, `8-9`, `10-11` or `unknown`. Invalid parameters:
`400`.

Conventions:

* A **group** is an object with its key fields and `sessions`, the number of distinct
  sessions in it (for games this is the brief's "unique sessions"). A group that has no
  play keeps its zeros.
* **A session counts once, on the day it started** (on the school's clock), with
  everything it did; a range's sessions are the sum of its days' sessions.
* **Students** are counted by their code, an older code linked to a newer one counting
  as the newer one (`totals.students.active`, `games[].students`, `bands[].students`:
  distinct over the range; `daily[].students`: distinct per day). Guests and v2
  sessions are never students. `levels[].students` is each day's distinct students
  added up over the range (a child who plays a level on three days counts three times).
  Student counts cover the days from `factsSince`; a frozen day has `students` and
  `guestMinutes` `null`.
* Rates and shares are 0..1 with 4 decimals and `null` when the denominator is 0.
  Minutes have 1 decimal (`avgEngagedMinutesPerSession` 2), seconds 1, tiers 2,
  scores 1, milliseconds are whole.
* A batch kept offline and delivered later counts on the day it was played. Engaged
  time is each game visit's: from its close (`gx`) and, for v3, also from the running
  time (`gp`) of a visit that never closed.
* Histograms: `rt` reaction time `<300, <500, <800, <1200, <2000, ≥2000` ms; `il` input
  latency `<8, <16, <33, <50, <100, ≥100` ms; frames `smooth ≤20, ok ≤34, choppy ≤250,
  stall >250` ms; `replayIndex` `0, 1, 2, 3–4, 5–9, 10+` prior starts of the same round
  in the session; `playsBefore` `0, 1, 2–4, 5–9, 10+` visits before; `profileAge` new,
  1–6, 7–29, 30+ days; `daysSinceLast` same day, 1, 2–6, 7+, first time.
* Round codes: `w` win, `l` loss, `d` draw, `e` neutral end (endless runs, two-player
  modes), `q` quit. Endless games end with `e`, so their completion rate is 0 and
  their win rate `null`: read `rounds.codes` and `dropOffRate` for them.
* A device bucket and an age band count a session under its first batch's.
* Days already rolled up come from the rollups; today (and yesterday until 01:00 at
  the school, or any day the cron has not reached) from the facts, with the same
  definitions. A day rolled again after late data shows the late play within about an
  hour. On Cloudflare the answer for the days not rolled yet is kept 10 minutes.

#### `GET /v1/admin/live`

Sessions whose last batch arrived in the current minute or the four before it (300 s
at minute resolution), and the game each one has open (opened with `go` and not yet
closed with `gx`; `se` closes everything; a session forgotten after 5 quiet minutes has
nothing open). A batch delivered late from a PC's offline queue counts as a sign of
life when it arrives; a repeated batch does not. `students` are distinct student codes
(linked codes as one), `guests` v3 sessions without a code, `unknown` sessions from PCs
still on wire version 2, `pcs` distinct PC codes.

#### `GET /v1/admin/settings` and `POST /v1/admin/settings`

The school's clock, retention, storage and today's usage:

```jsonc
{

    "factsSince": "2026-10-28", "legacyUntil": "2026-10-28", "v3Since": "2026-11-02" },
  "keep": { "days": 400, "source": "env", "rollupDays": 800 },   // source: env (RETENTION_DAYS) or owner
  "storage": { "bytes": 82000000, "limit": 500000000, "guardAt": 425000000, "trimmedBefore": "" },
  "usage": { "day": "2026-11-26", "reads": 450000, "writes": 34000, "readsLimit": 5000000, "writesLimit": 100000, "batchEvery": 60 },

  "accepts": [2, 3],
  "pcs": { "new": 14, "seen14d": 12 }                   // PC codes known, and seen in the last 14 days
}
```

`usage` is UTC (D1's day), as far as the server's own meter knows ("about": an instance
that stops loses its last minute of counts).

`POST` takes a JSON body (`Content-Type: application/json`, at most 4 KB) with any of
`tz` (an IANA zone this runtime knows), `source: "dashboard"` (only with `tz`),
`weekStart` (`"sun"` or `"mon"`) and `keepDays` (`400` or `760`), and answers like `GET`.
Anything else is `400 {"error": "<field>"}`; another media type `415`.

* **Where the school's zone comes from** (`clock.source`): `none` (nothing known yet:
  UTC); `dashboard` (`{tz, source: "dashboard"}`, the signed-in browser's zone, taken only
  while the source is `none` or `dashboard`); `pc` (the first v3 batch with a zone, while
  the source is `none` or `dashboard`, then the nightly vote); `pcs` (locked: the nightly
  vote found 3 PCs seen in the last 14 days reporting the top zone); `owner` (`{tz}`
  without `source`). Nothing changes `pcs` or `owner` automatically, and only the owner
  changes `pcs`.
* A new zone moves every rolled day (since `factsSince`, and not trimmed by the storage
  guard) to the new clock: the 5-minute cron rebuilds them one at a time, newest first,
  as far as each UTC day's writes leave room (see *Rollups* under Operations: at a busy
  school about one day a school day, more at weekends), and `rebuild` shows how far it
  is. The facts never change. A day that is today again on the new clock (the clock moved
  west after it was rolled) is read from the facts until it is over, then rebuilt.
* The week start follows the zone while `weekSource` is `auto` (Sunday in Riyadh, Cairo
  and the other zones `clock.mjs` lists, Monday elsewhere); `weekStart` sets it for good.
* `keepDays` overrides `RETENTION_DAYS`: 400 days (a school year and the summer) or 760
  (two). Keeping more is refused with `400 {"error": "storage"}` when the database,
  growing in proportion, would pass the storage guard.

#### `GET /v1/admin/students?from&to&band[&after]`

Every student who played in the period, by code. A student is a canonical code: an
older code linked to a newer one counts as the newer one, with its history. `band`
keeps the student-days whose first session was in that band. Today and the other days
not rolled yet come from the facts. Students come in order of their code, as many as
fit in 1.5 MB of JSON (D1 refuses a value over 2 MB; a school year of a busy school is
about 1.3 MB): when more are left the answer has `"next"`, the last code it holds, and
`&after=` that code gives the next page (the dashboard asks for every page and joins
them). On Cloudflare the answer is kept 10 minutes, so a refresh on any instance sends
kept text.

```jsonc

#### `GET /v1/admin/student?u&from&to`

One student's page; `u` is any of their codes. A code the server does not know: `404
{"error": "student"}`. `days`, `games` and `weekly` come from the rollups (and the facts
of the days not rolled yet); `hours`, `rounds`, `sessions` and `persist` from the facts.

#### `GET /v1/admin/game?slug&from&to&band`

One game's page. `stats`, `flowsIn` and `flowsOut` cover the rolled days only (up to
last night); the rest also today.

```jsonc

#### `GET /v1/admin/stats?from&to&metrics=a,b,...&band[&slug]`

The research metrics of `r_stat`, summed over the rolled days of the period (up to
`range.rolledThrough`), for every game or the game `slug`. `metrics` is a comma-separated
subset of `hour, rhour, sesslen, daymin, games, visitlen, flow, attempt, tenure, persist,
fatigue, qrun, tier, tutorial` (`docs/RESEARCH_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md`, §D.2, gives each
one's keys `k1` and `k2`); the answer lists them in that order. Rows are sorted by their
keys. `columns` holds the keys and only the sums the asked metrics have (every other sum
is always 0 in their rows), in the order below; read a value by its column's name.

```jsonc
{ "v": 1, "range": { ..., "rolledThrough": "2026-10-28" }, "metrics": ["hour", "flow"], "slug": null,
  // all the sums: n, students, w, l, d, e, q, ms, wall_ms, win_ms, hits, misses, rt_sum, rt_n, score_sum,
  // score_n, tier_sum, tier_n, dda_sum, dda_n, inputs, gap_sum, gap_n; hour and flow have these:
  "columns": ["a", "metric", "slug", "k1", "k2", "n", "students", "ms", "gap_sum", "gap_n"],
  "rows": [ ["", "flow", "", "air-hockey", "", 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] ],
  "clock": { ... } }
```

#### `GET /v1/admin/cohorts?from&to&band`

Retention by the week a student's profile started (the earliest of their codes), for
the school weeks of the period from `v3Since` on (`[]` before any version 3 batch):
`size` students, and how many of them played in that week and each of the 12 after it,
over the rolled days (`null` for a week not reached yet; weeks after `to` count while
they are reached).

```jsonc
{ "v": 1, "range": { ... }, "weekStart": "sun",
  "cohorts": [ { "week": "2026-10-18", "size": 45, "active": [45, 18, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null] } ],
  "clock": { ... } }
```

#### `GET /v1/admin/pcs?from&to`

Every PC with a code that played in the period, by code.

```jsonc
{ "v": 1, "range": { ... },
  "pcs": [ { "p": "01e890fc1672", "label": "01E8", "firstDay": "2026-10-28", "lastDay": "2026-10-28",
    "days": 1, "sessions": 4,
    "students": 4,                             // distinct, from the facts
    "guests": 0, "minutes": 19.6,
    "smoothShare": 0.9278, "stallShare": 0.0008,   // frames up to 20 ms; over 250 ms
    "avgLoadMs": 926, "slowInputShare": 0.0198,    // input latency of 50 ms or more
    "errors": 0, "npMax": 4, "newProfiles": 4, "z": "Asia/Riyadh", "build": "5c18c6d2d1c052ad",
    "flags": ["forgets"] } ],                  // full, forgets, choppy, old (below)
  "clock": { ... } }
```

Flags: `full`, it reached 24 profiles; `forgets`, on some day it made 3 or more new
profiles, in half or more of its sessions; `choppy`, under 80% of its frames were
smooth; `old`, its build is not that of the PC seen last.

#### `GET /v1/admin/export?file&from&to[&after]`

One page of a research file: `200`, `Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8`, at most
2,500 lines **without a header** (each ending in a line feed; SQL joins them, so the
Worker sends one string), `X-Rows: <lines>` and,
unless it is the last page, `X-Next: <cursor>`; the next page is the same request with
`&after=<cursor>`. A cursor that is not this file's: `400 {"error": "after"}`. The
dashboard writes the header (its data dictionary lists the same columns as
`export.mjs` `COLUMNS`), the BOM and the zip.

* No value is quoted, because none can hold a comma, a quote or a line break: each is a
  number, an ISO date, a time `HH:MM:SS` or a token the server validated (codes, slugs,
  round ids, bands, builds, zone names, the words below). Empty means unknown or not
  applicable; `-1` never appears; `.` is the decimal mark.
* Days, weekdays (1 = Sunday … 7 = Saturday) and times are the school's clock, each at
  the row's own moment (a round's start, a mark's time).
* `student_linked` is the student's canonical code (an older code linked to a newer one
  gives the newer one); empty for guests.
* Pages follow a key, never an offset, so each row is read once. A daily file's page
  covers a few weeks; one can be empty and still have `X-Next`.

minutes, or the removed or linked code. Flags are `0` or `1`.
`removed_day` is the day of the code's latest removal from a PC, empty once the code
played after it (a teacher moved the profile to another PC); every removal stays in
`events` as `profile_removed`.

#### `POST /v1/admin/forget`

Body `{"u": "<code>"}`: forgets the student of that code, with every code linked to it
(see "What is collected and kept"). Answers how much went:

```json
{ "v": 1, "removed": { "codes": 2, "sessions": 14, "visits": 41, "rounds": 160, "marks": 30 }, "clock": { ... } }
```

A code the server does not hold answers zeros (for 8 days its play from before the forget
is still dropped if a PC sends it, and so is every mark naming it from a session that
started by the forget or before the code played again). A link to the code that a PC tells more than 8
days after the forget is stored again: it names only the code, and forgetting again
removes it with the student it is linked to.

#### `POST /v1/admin/link` and `DELETE /v1/admin/link?u=`

`POST` body `{"u": "<code>", "to": "<code>"}`: `u`, and every code linked to it, count
as `to`'s student from now on, their history included (one hop deep: links to `u` move
to `to`'s canonical code). Answers `{"ok": true, "u", "to": "<to's canonical code>"}`. A
code the server does not know: `404 {"error": "student"}`; `to` is `u` or already counts
as `u`: `400 {"error": "cycle"}`. A PC links codes the same way when a profile carries
an older code of the same child (the `cd` mark).

`DELETE` with `?u=` (or a JSON body `{"u"}`): `u` counts as itself again. Answers
`{"ok": true}`, or `{"ok": false}` when `u` had no link.

#### `POST /v1/admin/rebuild`

Body `{}`: every rolled day since `factsSince` (and not trimmed by the storage guard)
waits to be counted again; the 5-minute cron recounts one day at a time, newest first,
with the diff re-roll (only the rows that change are written, and rows left without
facts are deleted, so a recount after a forget writes a few hundred rows a day where a
full rebuild would write every row twice), within the day's read and write allowance.
Answers `{"pending": <days waiting>}`. Use it after a forget, so that the school-wide
counts lose that student too.

## Operations

* **Backup.** Cloudflare: D1 can restore the database to any minute of the last 7 days
  on the free plan (*Time Travel*). Node: the
  database is one file plus its write-ahead log; take a consistent copy while the server
  runs with SQLite's `VACUUM INTO`, for example nightly from cron:
  `sqlite3 /var/lib/sg-telemetry/telemetry.db "VACUUM INTO '/backups/telemetry-$(date +%F).db'"`,
  or without the `sqlite3` tool:
  `node --no-warnings -e "new (require('node:sqlite').DatabaseSync)(process.argv[1]).exec(\"VACUUM INTO '\" + process.argv[2] + \"'\")" telemetry.db backup.db`.
  Keep backups no longer than `RETENTION_DAYS` (they are copies of the same data) and
  encrypt them at rest. To restore, stop the server and replace the file (delete stale
  `-wal`/`-shm` files).
* **Retention.** The daily purge deletes, by the school's local day, the facts of the
  sessions that started more than `keep` days ago (`keep_days` chosen on the dashboard,
  else `RETENTION_DAYS`), at most 600 sessions a night (about 15,000 rows written; more
  than a busy school's day, and the 5-minute cron deletes the rest when the day's writes
  leave room, so a shorter retention reaches its cutoff within days, never in one
  batch), and moves `facts_since` on with them (to the day after the newest
  session deleted, and to the cutoff once none older is left); the frozen daily totals of
  milestone 2 by UTC receipt day after `keep` days, a week of them a night
  (`legacy_until` is cleared once the last one goes); batch ids after 30 days, the usage counts after 60
  days, kept KPI parts of an older rollup version, and live rows once they leave the
  5-minute window (by the next batch or live query, and by a sweep every 5 minutes on
  Cloudflare and every minute on Node, so within 10 minutes even with no traffic). The
  rollups and their `roll_days` rows go after the larger of 800 days and `keep`, a day
  at a time, deleted by the 5-minute cron when it has no day to roll (so the daily purge
  stays within D1's statement limit); the daily purge deletes the students and PCs last
  seen before that cutoff, with their PC lists, attempt counters and links (until then a
  period the rollups hold lists its students with their bands, days, PCs and links, and
  a student's page and the cohorts answer as before). The codes a forget keeps go after 8
  days, deleted by the 5-minute cron when it has no day to roll. Lowering the retention starts at the next purge
  (Node: the next start). To erase everything on Node, stop the server and delete the database
  files; on Cloudflare, delete the Worker and its D1 database `school-games-telemetry`
  in the Cloudflare dashboard.
* **Storage guard.** When the database passes 425 MB at the daily purge, the round rows
  of the oldest 30 days of facts are to go (sessions, visits and every rollup stay, so
  charts keep working): the purge sets `trim_to`, and the 5-minute cron deletes them 800
  sessions a run (about 9,000 rows) when it has no day to roll and the day's writes leave
  room, moving `trimmed_before` on; the next trim waits until the file has grown again
  (SQLite reuses the freed space first). Days before `trimmed_before` are never rebuilt
  for a new zone. Download the research files each term.
* **Rollups.** Every 5 minutes (Node: at start and every 5 minutes) the cron rolls at most
  one of the school's local days into the `r_*` tables: first the oldest day not rolled
  yet (yesterday from 01:00 at the school; only one instance can make that roll), then a
  day waiting for a full rebuild after a change of zone (newest first), then a day that
  late batches reached (at most once an hour per day), then a day waiting for a recount
  (newest first). A day still running on the school's clock is never rolled again. After
  yesterday's roll, the PCs seen in the last 14 days vote for the school's zone. A
  rebuild, a re-roll, a recount or a catch-up deletion starts only while the day's reads
  stay under 3 million (2 million by re-rolls) and the day's writes, plus its estimate
  (twice the rows the day's rollups took for a full rebuild, those rows for a diff),
  plus 40,000 for the rest of a school day's batches, roll and purge, stay at or under
  85,000; otherwise it waits, if need be for the next UTC day. A full rebuild of a busy
  school's day writes about 16,000 rows (its 8,000 rollup rows deleted and written
  again), so at most two run in a UTC day: a zone change at a busy school rebuilds about
  two days a day, and never brings the day near D1's 100,000. Each roll raises the rollup
  version, so the dashboard's kept answers are made again.
* **Monitoring.** `GET /v1/health`. The Node process exits when it cannot start (port in
  use, unreadable database), so the supervisor (Docker, systemd) reports or restarts it.
  On Cloudflare, the Worker's *Metrics* tab shows requests and errors without logs.
* **Upgrades.** The store creates and upgrades its tables itself (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`, the schema version in the `meta` table), so a deploy has no migration step.
  It goes one version step per request: on Cloudflare the first request after a deploy
  that needs a step does only that step and is answered `503` with `Retry-After: 2` (a
  daily or 5-minute cron that meets it does nothing else either); the Node host takes
  every step at start. Schema 3 (milestone 2) becomes schema 4 in one step: the facts,
  settings and rollup tables are added, `seen` is dropped, `live` is made again with the
  codes, and the daily totals stay, read only, for the days up to the update. A database
  of the first server (one table per event kind) is folded into the daily totals first
  (schema 3, with its `user_version` raised so the first server refuses it) and becomes
  schema 4 on the next request. A server refuses a database newer than itself; a server
  older than schema 4 refuses a database it has upgraded, so going back means D1 *Time
  Travel* (7 days) to just before the deploy, then deploying the older server.
* **Size and cost.** Measured on the Node driver, which bills a written row once for its
  table and once for each secondary index, as D1 does: the first v3 batch of a session
  writes 12 rows (its session row is 4: the row, `UNIQUE (s)` and two indexes), a later
  batch 5, a batch of 200 events one row per visit and round plus 2; a v2 batch about
  13. A batch takes at most 20 statements, and the request that upgrades the database
  at most 45 (D1 allows 50 per request). The other invocations' worst cases are in

  school.

### Storage

Schema 4 (`docs/RESEARCH_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md`, "Storage on D1", has the exact columns):

| Tables | What they hold |
|---|---|
| `st_sessions` | One row per play session: its codes (`u`, `p`, `''` when unknown), wire version, band, build, mode, device buckets, start (`start_s`, with `clock` `w` from the PC's elapsed seconds or `r` estimated from the receipt time; never before the first day of the facts, so a v2 tab open across the deploy counts on the deploy day), the PC's zone, the session start's fields (exact profile age, days since last play, level, profiles on the PC, classroom mode, and the v2 buckets), how it ended, and the server's numbering state for v2. Indexed by start and by student. |
| `st_visits`, `st_rounds`, `st_marks` | Game visits `(session, n)`, rounds `(session, n, k)` with their outcome, tier, score, hits, misses, reaction times and extras, the two-player flag and the student's attempt number, and marks (level-ups, hearts, tutorial steps, classroom timer, removed profiles, older codes). |
| `st_students`, `st_pcs`, `st_student_pcs`, `st_student_games`, `aliases` | Per student code: label, first and last play, bands, profile age; per PC code: first and last play, zone, buckets, build; who played on which PC; rounds ended per student and game (for attempt numbers); links from older codes to a student's code, one hop deep (`how`: `pc` from a PC's `cd` mark, `owner` from the dashboard). |
| `settings`, `usage`, `roll_days` | The school's zone and where it came from (and `tz_epoch`, raised with each change), the week start, the retention the owner chose, `facts_since`, `legacy_until`, `v3_since`, the rollup version `rv`, `rolled_through`, `trimmed_before`, the codes a forget keeps for 8 days (`forgotten`), and the cron's bookkeeping (`rebuild`: days may wait for a full rebuild or a recount; `trimmed_size` and `trim_to`: the storage guard's trim); D1 rows read, written and read by rebuilds per UTC day, and the database size (each instance adds its counts once a minute, and each cron run its own); which local days are rolled up, whether late data (`dirty` 1), a new zone (2) or a recount (3) waits for them, when each was rolled and the rows its rollups took (`rows`, which a re-roll is estimated from). |
| `r_day`, `r_game_day`, `r_level_day`, `r_source_day`, `r_device_day`, `r_student_day`, `r_student_game`, `r_pc_day`, `r_stat` | Per-day rollups of the facts by the school's local day: milestone 2's daily totals with students, guests, two-player rounds, hearts, tutorials and session endings; per student code and per student and game; per PC; and `r_stat`, the research metrics (hour of play, session length, minutes per student-day, games per session, visit length, game-to-game flows, attempts, weeks of practice, what follows a round, tiredness, losses before quitting, tier, tutorials) per day, band and game. |
| `live`, `batches`, `kpi_cache`, `meta` | Sessions in the 5-minute live window (with codes and wire version); v2 batch ids for de-duplication; kept parts of admin answers, with the rollup version they were made with; the schema version. |
| `agg_days`, `agg_games`, `agg_levels`, `agg_sources`, `agg_devices` | Only on a database milestone 2 used: its daily totals per UTC receipt day, frozen. |

Every table but `st_sessions` is `STRICT, WITHOUT ROWID`. The only indexes beyond the
primary keys are `st_sessions_time`, `st_sessions_student`, `r_student_day_u` and
`r_student_game_u` (`r_stat` has none: every read of it finds its rows by day and band,
and an index by metric would add 60% to its size). There are no other columns.

### Free-plan arithmetic

Measured on the Node driver, which bills a written row once for its table and once for
each index as D1 does, with the simulated school of `simulate.mjs`: 600 children in 24
classes on 30 PCs, about 465 play sessions a school day, 11.3 batches per version 3
session (60 s timer, and one when a game closes), 3.5 game visits, 11.3 rounds and 9.6
engaged minutes per session. Scaled to a busy school of 500 sessions a school day:

| Rows written per school day | Simulated school | 500 sessions |
|---|---|---|
| Batches: 5.9 rows each (facts, student and PC rows, live rows, usage) | 30,000 | ≈ 32,500 |
| The night's first roll of the day: ≈ 6,600 rollup rows (4,500 of them `r_stat`), their index entries and the live sweep | 8,000 | ≈ 8,500 |
| Re-rolls of days that late batches reached | 50–350 each | ≈ 500 |
| **First year** | | **≈ 41,500 (42%)** |
| + the facts of a day deleted after 400 days (about 23 rows and index entries a session) | | + ≈ 11,400 |
| + the rollups of a day deleted after 800 days | | + ≈ 8,500 |
| **From the third year** | | **≈ 61,500 (62%)** |

From the third year a busy UTC day's writes can just pass 60,000, after which the PCs are
asked to send every 180 s (`X-Batch-Every`) for the rest of that UTC day. In Riyadh that
happens only at night, when the roll and the deletions run after the school day. The
daily limit of 100,000 stays out of reach.

| Storage | Measured | 500 sessions a school day |
|---|---|---|
| Facts | 1.24 KB a session | ≈ 135 MB for 400 days (about 220 school days) |
| Rollups | 0.55 MB a school day of 471 sessions, 59% of it `r_stat` | ≈ 130 MB a year of 220 school days |
| **After the first year** | | **≈ 265 MB (53%)** |

The rollups are kept 800 days (about 480 school days), so at this size the database
nears the storage guard (425 MB) in its third year, when the rollups' first days pass
800 days: about 285 MB of rollups and 135 MB of facts. The guard then deletes the round
rows of the oldest 30 days of facts (about 7 MB) each time the file has grown again, and
the database stays under the 500 MB limit. The spec's budget assumed 0.3 MB of rollups a
school day: `r_stat` alone takes 0.33 MB (about 4,500 rows of 23 sums), and a school this
busy should watch *Settings* → storage. Read costs
cannot be measured on Node (`node:sqlite` reports the rows returned, not the rows
SQLite read): the spec (`docs/RESEARCH_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md`, "Budget math") estimates 0.6
to 1.2 million rows read on a typical day with the dashboard open, and 2.1 to 2.6
million more for a school year's export.

**Requests:** about 5,650 batches, 289 crons and about 1,500 dashboard calls a day; a
school year's export adds about 700 pages of 2,500 lines (most of them `rounds`,
`visits` and `events`). About 8% of the 100,000.

**Statements and CPU per invocation.** D1 allows 50 statements per invocation; this
server keeps an admin answer to 20, the 5-minute cron to 35 and the daily purge to 25.
D1 also limits each statement: 100 KB of SQL, 100 bound parameters, 32 arguments per SQL
function, 100 result columns and 5 terms per compound `SELECT` (workerd's local D1
refuses a sixth `UNION ALL` term). `sqlite-d1.mjs` refuses a statement past any of these
as D1 would, so every test runs inside them; the rollups nest their `UNION ALL` parts
four at a time, and a KPI row of more than 32 columns comes as an array of arrays.
The Workers free plan allows 10 ms of CPU per invocation (only CPU counts, not the time
waiting for D1). The CPU column is JavaScript's time outside SQLite (wall time less the
time in `db.batch`), plus what the Worker's D1 binding does with each batch (the request
as JSON, the response parsed in D1's rows-and-columns form and an object made per row):
the median of cold runs (a new instance, nothing kept) over 30 days of the simulated
school with 120 and with 470 sessions a school day, on a 2.1 GHz server core:

| Invocation | Statements | CPU outside SQLite |
|---|---|---|
| `kpis` over frozen, rolled and open days | 13 | 5.2–5.5 ms |
| `students` (with 13 weeks of each of about 560 to 790 students) | 6 | 2.6 ms |
| `student` | 15 | 1.5–2.1 ms |
| `game` | 7 | 1.7–2.3 ms |
| `stats` (every metric of every game) | 4 | 1.4–1.7 ms |
| `cohorts` | 5 | 0.9–1.1 ms |
| `pcs` | 7 | 1.5 ms |
| `live`, `settings`, `POST settings` | 5, 2, 7 | under 0.1 ms |
| an `export` page (`rounds` or `visits`: 2,500 lines, about 410 KB) | 3 | 1.3–1.6 ms |
| an `export` page of `events` or `sessions` | 3 | 0.6–0.9 ms |
| `forget`, `link`, `DELETE link`, `rebuild` | 18, 7, 5, 5 | under 0.2 ms |
| the 5-minute cron's full rebuild of a day | 26 | |
| its first roll with the zone vote | 19 | |
| the daily purge with frozen days and the storage guard | 24 | |

The statement counts include the settings re-read (every 5 minutes) and the usage flush
(once a minute) that an invocation may carry. The tests hold the admin answers to 5 ms
and an export page to 3 ms on this measure, with 120 sessions a day; runs differ by
about a millisecond, and the first request of a new process takes up to twice as long
while the JavaScript engine warms up. A kept answer costs about 0.6 ms; a `kpis` whose
rolled part is kept and whose open day is made again, about 4.4 ms. The answers are made
as JSON text by SQL and sent as they are: the Worker parses none of a kept part, and
writes kept parts to `kpi_cache` inside the same statements that read them.

A lab whose PCs forget their profiles every night (a new code per child per day: 7,600
codes in 30 days) takes about 7 ms for a cold `kpis` and about 10 ms for a full
`students` page (1.5 MB, most of it the text crossing the D1 binding); the page size is
set so that a busy school's year of students fits in one page.

## Development

* Tests: `node --test --test-reporter=spec tools/tests/telemetry-server.test.mjs
  tools/tests/telemetry-worker.test.mjs tools/tests/telemetry-facts.test.mjs
  tools/tests/telemetry-rollups.test.mjs tools/tests/telemetry-clock.test.mjs` (the
  Node host on port 0 with a temporary database; the Worker entry with real `Request`s
  on the Node driver; the facts on the store; every rollup against a JavaScript oracle
  over the same facts; the school's clock; and comparisons with milestone 2's store and
  the first server's store from Git, skipped when those commits are not checked out).
* The Workers runtime on your machine (no Cloudflare account needed): `npm install` in
  `server/`, put `ADMIN_TOKEN=...` in `server/.dev.vars` (ignored by Git), then
  `npx wrangler dev` (local D1 in `.wrangler/`). Add `--test-scheduled` and open
  `/__scheduled` to run the daily purge, or `/__scheduled?cron=*/5+*+*+*+*` for the
  rollups and the sweep of the live rows. `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir /tmp/out`
  bundles without deploying.
* Synthetic data for the dashboard: a simulated school in Asia/Riyadh (600 children in
  24 classes, a lab of 30 PCs, Sunday to Thursday; guests, three PCs still on wire
  version 2, one PC that forgets its profiles every night, children on two PCs whose
  codes a teacher joined), sending at the portal sink's real cadence.
  `node server/simulate.mjs --url http://127.0.0.1:8787 [--sessions 300]` posts the
  sessions of the last half hour to a running server (same `--seed`, same batch ids, so
  a repeat adds nothing); `node server/simulate.mjs --db server/data/dev.db --days 28
  [--sessions 120]` writes four weeks of history straight into a Node database file (stop
  the server first, or use another file) and rolls each day up with the store's own
  rollups, as the cron would. Every generated batch passes `schema.mjs`.
